//! In-world track editor: place / delete / relabel checkpoints with chat
//! commands and block clicks.
//!
//! `/client LiveSplit edit on` enables edit mode and installs a
//! `Server.SendBlock` override ([`hook`]). While armed (via
//! `edit place`), the next two block clicks are consumed as the two
//! corners of a checkpoint AABB instead of building/breaking world blocks
//! -- the clicked block is reverted locally and never sent to the server.
//! The committed checkpoint flows through `splits::editor_insert`, the
//! same `Track` mutation path the chat/`.lss` sources feed into, and
//! becomes visible through the existing `/client LiveSplit show` HUD on
//! the next tick.
//!
//! v1 is **commands + chat feedback only** -- no in-world rendering
//! (rubber-band preview, corner-A marker, selection highlight). Those are
//! deferred to the track-editor HUD work.
