//! In-world track editor: place / remove / relabel checkpoints with chat
//! commands and block clicks.
//!
//! `/client LiveSplit edit on` enables edit mode and installs a
//! `Server.SendBlock` override ([`hook`]). While armed (via
//! `edit add`), the next two block clicks are consumed as the two
//! corners of a checkpoint AABB instead of building/breaking world blocks
//! -- the clicked block is reverted locally and never sent to the server.
//! The committed checkpoint flows through `splits::editor_add`, the
//! same `Track` mutation path the chat/`.lss` sources feed into, and
//! becomes visible through the existing `/client LiveSplit show` HUD on
//! the next tick.
//!
//! A **rubber-band preview** (selection 255, white translucent) shows the
//! tentative AABB while the player aims after clicking corner A; it updates
//! every frame via [`preview`] and disappears on commit or cancel.
//! Corner-A marker, selection highlight, and edit-mode status overlay are
//! still deferred to the track-editor HUD work.
