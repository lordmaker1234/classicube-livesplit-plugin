//! `Server.SendBlock` chain override for the in-world editor.
//!
//! `SendBlock` is the engine's single block-action hook: it fires for
//! every block the local player places or breaks (in both singleplayer
//! and multiplayer). We splice our own function into that slot, save the
//! previous one, and chain through to it when the editor isn't consuming
//! the click. The reload-safe install/uninstall mirrors the
//! `track_source` `Protocol.Handlers` chain pattern, with one extra case
//! for reconnect (`MPConnection_Init` re-points `SendBlock` back to the
//! engine original, dropping us -- we re-splice when the live slot equals
//! the original we saved).
