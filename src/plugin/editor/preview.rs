//! Rubber-band preview for mid-placement checkpoint authoring.
//!
//! While a placement is armed (`edit add` / `edit redraw`) and the first
//! corner has been clicked, draw a live tentative box from corner A to
//! wherever the player is currently aiming, updating every frame. The
//! second click commits a permanent checkpoint whose AABB matches the
//! preview exactly -- both are built by `geometry::aabb_from_block_corners`.
//!
//! Rendered via `Selections_Add` on a reserved id (255) so no custom GPU
//! code is needed. White + reduced alpha reads as "tentative" and is
//! visually distinct from the committed kind-colored checkpoint boxes
//! (`hud/boxes.rs`, ids 200..=254).
//!
//! The live aimed-at block is read cross-platform through `Camera.Active
//! ->GetPickedBlock` -- the `Camera` global is `CC_VAR`-exported on all
//! platforms including Windows (unlike the plain `extern Game_SelectedPos`
//! which is not exported from `ClassiCube.exe`).
