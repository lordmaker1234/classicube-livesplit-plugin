//! Translucent colored cuboids for the loaded track's AABB checkpoints.
//!
//! Each `Trigger::Aabb` checkpoint is drawn via ClassiCube's built-in
//! `Selections_Add` / `Selections_Remove` `CC_API`, color-coded by
//! `CheckpointKind`. The engine re-renders its selection list every frame,
//! so this layer never touches the GPU -- it's pure state management: each
//! tick [`reconcile`] diffs the desired `(kind, aabb, is_next)` set against
//! the installed one ([`LAST_APPLIED`]) and only calls the engine on a
//! change. The next-target box is drawn at a higher alpha (same kind hue).
