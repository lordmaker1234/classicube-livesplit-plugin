/// A small fixed track used by the `/client LiveSplit loadtest` chat
/// subcommand for development. Eight checkpoints arranged as two AABB
/// rows along the +X axis with a `MapLoaded` Split in the middle and
/// a `MapLoaded` End on the far side. The encoded wire form exercises
/// both inline and `LS label` follow-up forms for both `cp` and `map`
/// triggers: `Split B` (AABB) and the middle map carry overflow-length
/// labels that force the follow-up fallback; the End map and every
/// other AABB fit inline.
///
/// The first three AABBs have no `MapLoaded` ahead of them, so their
/// scope falls back to `SplitsState.starting_map` (captured at load
/// time) — they fire only on whatever world the player loaded the
/// track on. After the `MapLoaded("spiralp+livesplit2")` Split, the
/// next three AABBs are scoped to that map by the running scope walk
/// in `step()`.
